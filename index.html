                Business is the activity of making one's living or making money by producing or buying and selling
                products (such as goods and services). need quotation to verify Simply put, it is "any activity or
                enterprise entered into for profit. It does not mean it is a company, a corporation, partnership, or

                Having a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner
                of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the business. If the business acquires
                debts, the creditors can go after the owner's personal possessions. A business structure does not allow

                About Business India .....
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Business India is a fortnightly business news magazine founded by brothers Ashok Hotchand Advani, Hiroo
                Advani and Rajkumar Advani in 1978 and published in Mumbai, India. In 2001, the magazine had a
                circulation of 88,100 copies and it increased to 526,000 in 2006. The magazine is considered pioneer of
                Indian business magazines.The magazine started publication in English but is now also available in other
                Indian languages.
                When Ashok Advani conceived of the idea of a mainstream, business magazine in 1978, he had a very clear
                vision. That vision was to act as a catalyst and create a climate in which business and entrepreneurship
                could flourish and thereby enable the Indian economy to rapidly join the ranks of more advanced world
                economies.
                Today this credo is as valid as it was in 1978. Over the last three decades, the magazine has in fact
                remained truly committed to its values and beliefs. In the process it has built enormous goodwill and a
                loyal following in corporate India. It would not be an exaggeration to say that in many ways Business
                India is the voice of corporate India at its best. Which is why Business India has a national presence,
                commands respect from the business community, government and industry leaders.

                Setting the trend ....
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Being the pioneer in the arena of business journalism, Business India came up with many firsts in the
                form of special reports and surveys as well as full fledged cover stories that went onto become best
                sellers among all magazine issues. Cover stories of Super 100, Best B Schools, Where to Invest, Best
                Bank and Highest Paid Executives have gone on to make history by their sheer popularity.
                Moreover, Business India pioneered new readership markets, when others saw none, and created a new breed
                of business reporters and journalists.

                first by Business India was the 'Businessman of the Year Awardâ€™. It was instituted in 1982 as a part of
                the magazine's mission to commend outstanding performance by a businessman in India in a particular
                year; to honour and recognize excellence in business and to act as a role model for others to follow.
                Not only is it the first such distinction to be introduced in the country, but over the years it has
                built up enormous goodwill and prestige. The exclusivity of this award makes it stand out in a sea of
                clones. The pre-eminence of the selection panel and the selection process, has ensured that Business
                India's Businessman of the Year is a distinction that remains the most coveted by the business
                community.
                At the time of its launch, the business precinct was considered forbidden territory for journalism.
                Unfazed by what was considered socially incorrect in those days, Business India ventured out to achieve
                its objectives.
